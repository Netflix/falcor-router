/**
 * Takes in the matched path and virtual path and creates the
 * set of paths that represent the virtualPath being stripped
 * from the matchedPath.
 *
 * @example
 * Terms:
 * * Relative Complement: Of sets A and B the relative complement of A in B is
 * the parts of B that A do not contain.  In our example its virtualPath (A) in
 * matchedPath (B).
 *
 * Example:
 * matchedInput = [[A, D], [B, E], [C, F]]
 * virtualIntput = [A, Keys, C]
 *
 * This will produce 2 arrays from the matched operation.
 * [
 *   [D, [B, E], [C, F]],
 *   [A, [B, E], [F]]
 * ]
 *
 *
 * All the complexity of this function is hidden away in strip and its inner
 * stripping functions.
 * @param {PathSet} matchedPath
 * @param {PathSet} virtualPath
